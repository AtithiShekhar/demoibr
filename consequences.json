          "consequences_if_untreated": "If osteoarthritis is not treated, the condition will progressively worsen over months to years. The cartilage in the affected joints will continue to degenerate, leading to increased bone-on-bone friction. This results in chronic and often severe joint pain, stiffness, swelling, and tenderness. The range of motion in the affected joint will progressively decrease, leading to significant functional disability and difficulty performing daily activities such as walking, climbing stairs, dressing, or gripping objects. Muscle weakness and atrophy around the joint can occur due to disuse and pain. Joint deformities may develop, further impairing function. The chronic pain and disability can lead to a reduced quality of life, psychological distress (e.g., depression, anxiety), and social isolation. Reduced physical activity due to pain and limited mobility can also indirectly contribute to the development or worsening of other chronic conditions like obesity, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes, and increase the risk of falls.",
