This results in decreased blood pressure, inadequate tissue perfusion, and organ damage. Severe bleeding can also lead to aspiration of blood into the lungs, causing aspiration pneumonia and respiratory failure. Furthermore, significant blood loss can cause acute kidney injury (AKI) due to decreased renal perfusion. In patients with underlying cardiovascular disease, severe anemia from UGIB can precipitate myocardial ischemia or infarction.",

Repeated episodes of bleeding can lead to chronic iron deficiency anemia, requiring ongoing transfusions. Furthermore, persistent bleeding and the need for multiple transfusions can lead to iron overload (hemochromatosis), which can damage the liver, heart, and other organs.
