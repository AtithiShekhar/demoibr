The USPI also states that \"Whenever adverse reactions are moderate or severe, furosemide dosage should be reduced or therapy withdrawn.\" This suggests that careful monitoring and dose adjustment based on clinical assessment and possibly hematologic parameters could potentially mitigate the severity or prevent the ADR from progressing. It falls under preventable because dose adjustment is mentioned as a reaction to moderate/severe ADRs.",
