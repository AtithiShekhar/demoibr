        "reasoning": "While heart failure is a serious condition, in the context of NSAID-induced heart failure, it is often reversible with discontinuation of the drug and appropriate medical management to address the heart failure symptoms. The heart failure is typically due to fluid retention and increased afterload, which can be reversed.",

        "reasoning": "Ibuprofen, an NSAID, can exacerbate or induce heart failure, especially in patients with pre-existing cardiovascular conditions or renal impairment.

        "reasoning": "Stroke risk with NSAIDs like ibuprofen is dose-dependent and related to cardiovascular risk factors. The USPI emphasizes using the lowest effective dose and avoiding exceeding the recommended dosage. Therefore, adherence to dosing guidelines and consideration of patient-specific cardiovascular risk factors can potentially reduce the risk.",
