            "conclusion": "Nonselective inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX) by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs frequently induces renal failure in decompensated cirrhosis. Studies in experimental cirrhosis suggest that selective inhibitors of the inducible isoform COX-2 do not adversely affect renal function. However, very limited information is available on the effects of these compounds on renal function in human cirrhosis. This investigation consists of a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial aimed at comparing the effects of the selective COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib (200 mg every 12 hours for a total of 5 doses) on platelet and renal function and the renal response to furosemide (40 mg intravenously) with those of naproxen (500 mg every 12 hours for a total of 5 doses) and placebo in 28 patients with cirrhosis and ascites. A significant reduction (P < .05) in glomerular filtration rate (113 +/- 27 to 84 +/- 22 mL/min), renal plasma flow (592 +/- 158 to 429 +/- 106 mL/min) and urinary prostaglandin E(2) excretion (3430 +/- 430 to 2068 +/- 549 pg/min) and suppression of the diuretic (urine volume: 561 +/- 128 to 414 +/- 107 mL/h) and natriuretic (urine sodium: 53 +/- 13 to 34 +/- 10 mEq/h) responses to furosemide were observed in the group of patients treated with naproxen but not in the other two groups. Naproxen, but not celecoxib or placebo, significantly inhibited platelet aggregation (72% +/- 8% to 47% +/- 8%, P < .05) and thromboxane B(2) production (41 +/- 12 to 14 +/- 5 pg/mL, P < .05). In conclusion, our results indicate that short-term administration of celecoxib does not impair platelet and renal function and the response to diuretics in decompensated cirrhosis. Further studies are needed to evaluate the long-term safety of this drug in cirrhosis."

            "title": "Effects of imidazole-salicylate on renal function and the diuretic action of furosemide in cirrhotic patients with ascites.",
            "conclusion": "Imidazole-salicylate is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug with limited inhibitory effects on prostaglandin synthesis. The renal effects of this drug were investigated by a double-blind cross-over study in 10 patients with cirrhosis and ascites. Two therapeutic doses of imidazole-salicylate (750 mg each) were given at midnight and 08:00 h and 80 mg of furosemide were injected intravenously at 09:00 h. The same procedure was followed on another day but a placebo replaced imidazole-salicylate. Renal function (creatinine clearance, free water and electrolyte excretions) and urinary excretion of prostaglandin E, 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha and thromboxane B2 were evaluated for 8 h after the first dose of the drug and for 2 h after furosemide injection. Platelet thromboxane production was also determined 9 h after the first administration of drug or placebo. Imidazole-salicylate did not affect renal function or inhibit kidney prostanoid production either under basal conditions or after the stimulating effect of furosemide. On the contrary, imidazole-salicylate significantly inhibited platelet thromboxane production (45.8 +/- 9 vs. 69.4 +/- 7.5 ng/ml, P < 0.05). These results suggest that imidazole-salicylate is an anti-inflammatory drug that can be given to patients with decompensated cirrhosis without risk of inhibiting kidney prostaglandin synthesis or the renal response to furosemide."

            "title": "Comparison of diuretic effects and pharmacokinetics of torasemide and furosemide after a single oral dose in patients with hydropically decompensated cirrhosis of the liver.",
            "conclusion": "In a controlled double-blind randomized clinical trial, the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of 20 mg torasemide (1-isopropyl-3-([4-(3-methyl-phenylamino)pyridine]-3-sulfonyl)urea) (n = 10) and 40 mg furosemide (n = 9) were compared over 24 h after single oral administration to patients with ascites due to cirrhosis of the liver. The overall 24-h excretion of volume and sodium was not significantly different between patients receiving torasemide or furosemide. The diuretic effect of torasemide, however, was longer in duration than that of furosemide. This was in accordance with the pharmacokinetic behaviour of torasemide and furosemide. The serum elimination half-life of torasemide was longer (4.8 h) than that of furosemide (2.2 h) in these patients and also longer than that in healthy volunteers (3 h). The areas under the serum concentration-time curves for torasemide were higher than in healthy subjects by a factor of 2.5. In parallel with the considerably delayed formation of the diuretically inactive metabolite M5, which is formed via the diuretically active metabolite M1, the serum concentration of M1 was increased in these patients. However, the overall excretion of torasemide and the different metabolites was similar compared to healthy volunteers. These results indicate that the pharmacokinetics and metabolism of torasemide depend on liver function. No adverse reaction were experienced in either group."
