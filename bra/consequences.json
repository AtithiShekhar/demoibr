Severe bleeding can also lead to aspiration of blood into the lungs, causing aspiration pneumonia and respiratory failure. Furthermore, significant blood loss can cause acute kidney injury (AKI) due to decreased renal perfusion.

The underlying cause of chronic dizziness may also have long-term implications. For example, if dizziness is due to an unmanaged vestibular disorder, it can lead to long-term difficulties with gaze stabilization and balance.

If dizziness is caused by a stroke affecting the brainstem or cerebellum, failure to promptly diagnose and treat the stroke can lead to permanent neurological damage, disability, or death. Similarly, dizziness due to a cardiac arrhythmia or severe blood loss can rapidly progress to hemodynamic instability, shock, and death if not immediately addressed.
