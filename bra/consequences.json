The initial symptoms, such as rapid breathing, increased heart rate, and nausea, will progress to more critical conditions. The body's compensatory mechanisms will eventually fail, leading to profound metabolic acidosis, which impairs cellular function. This can result in organ dysfunction, including acute kidney injury, liver failure, and cardiac arrhythmias. Hypotension and shock are common consequences as the cardiovascular system becomes compromised. Ultimately, if left unaddressed, lactic acidosis can lead to coma and death due to multi-organ failure.",
